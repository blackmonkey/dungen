Things to do:

Relationships need work to add directionality.

Allow style dialog to restyle current map.

Magic effects for books

More staves

Connect hooks and oddities to the theme tagging system.

Add a random name generator and use it for NPCs and some monsters.

Flesh out the wilderness generator.

Monster customizer

Novel monster type generator

Add races to NPCs?

Add personal items and treasure to NPCs?

Give NPcs a goal and resident/visiting/raiding/passing through status?

Decouple magic item frequency from amount of treasure generated for node or have it replace some?

Should theme alter NPC class distribution?

Map library and dungen derived stocker.

Replace vis.js with Pixi.js.
